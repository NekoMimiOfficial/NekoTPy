# NekoTPy Docs

NekoTPy will be simple to code in and the docs are user friendly  
in the docs folder you'll find each version of the bot wrapper and what its capable of  

read the docs as following:  
in each doc md file you'll be reading through the main sections of what the version can do  
each section will contain the sub objects within the main object/class  
in each object you'll find what it does and what it expects the input to be as well as what the output will be  

so creating bots and reading the docs will be an easy task
