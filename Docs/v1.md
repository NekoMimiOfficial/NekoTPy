## Bot

the bot instance takes 1 positional argument which is the Token  
which can be called into a variable , the bot instance is a class  
`instance = NekoTPy.v1.Bot(TOKEN)`  

this class's __init__ will set these values
```
self.API
self.base
self.guid
self.safe
self.commands
self.loop
```
this version of the bot wrapper will pull 100 updates each time and is not configurable

> update_guid(self)  
this is an internal function that automatically gets called to set the Global Update ID
invocable by just running it  
`instance.update_guid()`  

> updater(self)  
this is an internal function that automatically gets called to get the updates from the bot API  
returns a dictionary , invocable by running

takes 2 positional arguments:  
message which is a string containing the message wanted to be sent  
id which is a string containing the chatid to send the message to  
returns a dictionary of the response data  
invocable by running  
`response = instance.send(message:str, id:str)`

## command 
the default command wrapper decorator (deprecated)  
wrap a function with this decorator to add it to the command queue  
the wrapped function takes 1 positional argument which is the context object  
```
@instance.command
def _command(context):
    pass
```
please note that your command name in telegram will be the same name your function is called in addition to the underscore at the beggining  
basically you name your commands starting with an underscore so in the previous example the command name is "command"
